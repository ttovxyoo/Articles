1 A former World War II guerrilla who later served as foreign secretary wants the name of the late President Ferdinand Marcos removed from the list of Filipino war heroes.
2 Marcos' name is among those inscribed at Fort Santiago as having been among thousands of Filipinos jailed in the 16th Century Spanish fort by the Japanese during the war.
3 'For the sake of history, for the sake of our youth, and for the sake of our future, we should now go review the records and remove the fake heroes from our lists,' former Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, who was also jailed at Fort Santiago, asked the National Historical Institute on Saturday.
4 Manglapus claimed neither he nor any other former guerrilla had actually seen Marcos at Fort Santiago. Marcos said he was held there soon after the April 1942 fall of Bataan but escaped.
5 'The former president was never seen in these (Fort Santiago) premises by any of the detainees,' Manglapus said.
6 Manglapus also cited U.S. reports that many of Marcos' medals were faked. Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in Hawaii three years later.
7 Marcos served as a junior officer with the U.S.-Philippine forces on the Bataan peninsula. After that, however, his activities during the war are clouded by controversy.
8 U.S. authorities have said the wartime destruction, irregular records-keeping and the passage of time make it all but impossible to verify details of war time service here.
