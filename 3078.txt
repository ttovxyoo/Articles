1 Christian Fittipaldi of Brazil, the nephew of two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Emerson Fittipaldi, has signed a contract to drive an Indy-car for Walker Racing this year.
2 The younger Fittipaldi, 24, a Formula One regular the past three years, has never driven an Indy-car. But the son of one-time Formula One driver Wilson Fittipaldi has known Walker for many years.
3 'When I was Wilson's chief mechanic in Formula One and Christian was a little boy, I told him that I would someday own a race team and that he would drive for me,' Walker said Thursday after making the announcement that Fittipaldi would team with holdover Robby Gordon.
4 'It's great to have Christian drive in this series,' Walker said. 'He and Robby will make great teammates.'
5 Fittipaldi, considered one of the bright young stars of European racing, will be introduced to oval tracks, including the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, this year.
6 'The 1995 season is going to be really fun,' he said. 'I'm sure Uncle Emerson can help me a lot, especially on the ovals. I think Walker Racing will be very competitive. The team is in a strong position this year. . Knowing all of Robby Gordon's achievements, he's one of the quickest guys out there. He will be a nice gauge for me.'
7 The 16-race Indy-car season opens March 5 with the Miami Grand Prix, a new event in the streets of downtown Miami.
