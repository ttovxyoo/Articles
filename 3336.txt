1 Two white men got out of a smoke-filled car that exploded minutes later, a witness testified Monday at the trial of white extremists accused of bombings aimed at derailing last year's election.
2 The 26 defendants, all members of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement, pleaded innocent to charges of murder, attempted murder and other counts.
3 All charges stemmed from a series of blasts in the Johannesburg area last April that killed 21 people and wounded more than 200. The explosions started two days before the nation's first all-race election that ended apartheid by bringing a black-led government to power.
4 The Afrikaner Resistance Movement, known by its Afrikaans-language initials AWB, had threatened to wage war against black rule. But the arrest of more than 30 members on the second day of the election ended the anti-voting violence.
5 At the trial Monday, witness Abraham Kuyani said he saw a car with two white men inside park on Bree Street in downtown Johannesburg on April 24, 1994.
6 The men got out and walked away, and Kuyani said he followed them because he saw smoke inside the car. He then heard an explosion and went back to find a hole in the ground where the car had been.
7 That explosion occurred around the corner from the headquarters of the African National Congress, the nation's leading black organization which won the voting that began two days later.
8 The AWB wants all the defendants to receive amnesty, saying their crimes were politically motivated. Under an amnesty law being drafted by the new ANC-led government, only political crimes committed before Dec. 7, 1993 -- the date a multiracial panel began helping to run the country prior to the election -- would be eligible for amnesty.
