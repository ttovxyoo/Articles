1 Portuguese Player of the Year Luis Figo of Sporting signed a three-year contract Wednesday with Italian club Parma, club president Giambattosta Pastorello announced.
2 Figo, a burly 23-year-old midfielder, signed with Parma two days after Portuguese coaches and sports writers voted him the top player for 1994.
3 'As of next season, I am a Parma player,' Figo said after signing the contract in the presence of his agent and officials of Parmalat, the team's corporate sponsor.
