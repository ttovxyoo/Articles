1 Police arrested a suspected Serb war criminal Tuesday for investigation of charges including accessory to genocide, but a judge later released the man.
2 A judge with the country's highest criminal court questioned the suspect and refused late Tuesday to issue a formal arrest warrant for the man, saying there was not enough evidence for such a move, the federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe said.
3 The man, whose name was withheld, remains under investigation.
4 The suspect was 'not a big fish' and not one of the 21 Serbs accused by an international tribunal in The Hague on Monday, said Ralf Hannich, spokesman for the prosecutor. Those charges set the stage for the first war crimes trial since World War II.
5 The 44-year-old man is suspected of belonging to a group of Serbian gunmen which reportedly plundered and set fire to Muslim houses near the Bosnian village of Hadzici. Muslim men who resisted were reportedly shot, while women and children were forced to leave.
6 He is also accused of beating a Muslim woman and robbing another, Hannich said.
7 Only one of the 21 suspects is in custody. Dusan Tadic, a former policeman and karate expert, was detained in Germany last February. Tadic is accused of 13 killings, torture, rape and beatings at the Omarska camp in northern Bosnia.
8 A law allowing the 39-year-old Tadic to be handed over to the Hague tribunal is expected to pass the German parliament in March.
9 Germany is conducting 43 investigations against Serbs -- including Tadic and the man detained Tuesday -- suspected of war crimes in former Yugoslavia, Hannich said. He wouldn't say how many were in Germany.
10 In 1993, Bosnian human rights activists presented the German government with a list of about 1,300 people they accused of war crimes. Some half a million refugees from former Yugoslavia live in Germany.
