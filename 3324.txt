1 Finland edged Sweden by two-tenths of a second after a thrilling duel down the stretch between Sami Repo and Henrik Forsberg to win a men's World Cup 20-kilometer cross-country ski relay Sunday at the Holmenkollen Ski Festival.
2 Forsberg, who led by eight seconds at the start of the final 5K freestyle lap, lost his balance about 10 meters from the finish line and Repo surged ahead.
3 Kari Hietamaki, Harri Kirvesniemi and Mika Kuusisto skied the other 5K laps for the Finns, who were timed in 49 minutes and 48 seconds. Finnish regulars Jari Isometsa and Mika Myllyla skipped the relay after competing in the grueling 50K Saturday.
4 Norway, without individual World Cup points leader Bjorn Daehlie, finished third in 49:56.6.
5 Skiers used the classical-style in the first two legs of the mixed-style relay, shortened to 20 kilometers for the first time in Holmenkollen's history.
6 The United States, with Justin Wadsworth, Marcus Nash, Pete Vordenberg and Carl Swenson, placed 13th and next to last in 53:55.6.
7 Russia, as expected, won the women's 20K relay in 58:23.1 with Norway second and Russia B third.
8 Olga Danilova, Larissa Lazutina, Nina Gavriliuk and Elena Valbe skied the Russian legs.
9 A mixed U.S.-Norwegian team was 10th in 1:03.48.0. Nina Kemppel skied the first leg and fellow American Leslie Thompson anchored the team.
