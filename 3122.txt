1 Thomas Muster and Alex Antonitsch overcame a second-set blip to beat Spanish doubles team Sergi Bruguera and Emilio Sanchez 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 Saturday and give Austria a 2-1 lead in their Davis Cup World Group match.
2 Bruguera, ranked No. 4 in the world, proved a weak partner for Sanchez, an experienced doubles player who with his now injured partner Sergio Casal has won many of the world's leading doubles titles.
3 'Today we had two singles players and two doubles players on court,' said Muster, a singles specialist. 'Alex played better than Sanchez, and I played better than Bruguera. So we won.'
4 'They were playing together for the first time, we know each other for 10 years . and trained well together this week,' said Antonitsch.
5 The Austrians broke Sanchez in the fifth game for the first service break and then, Bruguera dropped serve.
6 Antonitsch dropped his serve to give Spain the second set.
7 The crucial game of the match was the fifth game in the third set. After 17 minutes, 12 deuces and six break points for the Spaniards, Antonitsch held serve, pulling out two of Austria's total seven aces and covering for errors by Muster at the net.
8 Spain staved off the first two match points, but confusion between Sanchez and Bruguera led them to net a relatively easy volley.
9 Muster faces Bruguera in Sunday's first single. The Austrians must decide who will play the possibly decisive match against Costa. Schaller is said to be injured, and Antonitsch's strong showing Saturday must make him a candidate.
