1 Ten men were shot to death Saturday night in a series of attacks apparently linked to a feud between Sunni and Shiite Muslim militants, police said.
2 In the worst attack, four people were gunned down outside a club in central Karachi where Shiite men gather to play board games.
3 The Karachi Central District, an area wracked by political and religious violence, was the site for all but one of the killings, according to Sattar Sheikh, police superintendent for the area.
4 There were at least five separate attacks that accounted for the 10 deaths and nine injuries, according to police. Gunbattles continued late into the night and paramilitary troops were called in to the troubled areas to prevent further bloodshed.
5 Sheikh said the shootings appeared linked to the feud between Tehfuz Nifaz Jafaria, a militant Shiite group, and Sibah-e-Shabha, a militant Sunni group.
6 At least six of the 10 men killed were Shiites and a number had ties to Tehfuz Nifaz Jafaria, police said.
7 The sectarian rivalry is one of several ongoing battles in Karachi, a port city of 10 million people that has been plagued by violence. More than 800 people were killed in political, ethnic and religious violence last year.
8 The Sunni majority and the Shiite minority have historically had good relations in Muslim Pakistan. But militants from both sides have been waging hit-and-run attacks in Karachi over the past year.
