1 Nearly 200 female students marched through Dhaka Wednesday to demand their university drop its rule confining them to their dormitories after sunset and other regulations they regard as sexist.
2 The demonstrators chanted 'Down with male chauvinism' and carried placards reading 'Character can't be built by restrictions' and 'We want our freedom.'
3 Women make up one-third of Dhaka University's 28,000 students. The university, the nation's largest, is located in the capital of Islamic and male-dominated Bangladesh.
4 Although many women ignore the 40-year-old rules, the university can fine or expel those caught violating the regulations.
5 In addition to the prohibition on leaving their dormitories, the protesters want the university to scrap rules that discourage male students from talking to women on campus and require female students to receive permission from their parents to stay out overnight.
6 'The country's constitution does not discriminate between males and females, so why should the university authorities?' asked Rokayya Khatoon, a senior arts student.
7 Emajuddin Ahmed, vice chancellor of Dhaka University, met with a delegation of the protesters, and he reportedly told them their parents must ask the school to change the rules.
