1 Italian superstar Alberto Tomba won his tenth World Cup race of the season Saturday, scraping by Slovenia's Jure Kosir by seven hundredths of a second.
2 Tomba finished the demanding course in 2 minutes 21.96 seconds. Kosir clocked 2:22.03. Harald Strand-Nilsen, who was first after the opening run, was third in 2:22.10.
3 It marked a new season record for Tomba and helped offset his disappointment at the postponement of the World Championships.
4 Tomba now has 1,150 points in the overall standings and looks increasingly on target to win the overall title -- a feat which was previously unthinkable as he only skies the slalom and giant slalom, and misses the faster downhill and Super-G disciplines.
5 It was a nail-biting finish. Tomba lost time on the flat middle-part of the 53-gate course and was behind his friend Kosir. He recovered on the steep, icy final third, surging dramatically just before the finish line.
6 Tomba rushed to greet his Italian fans, relief and joy all over his face.
7 It was the first time he had won at Adelboden. This season he has won all seven slaloms and three of the five giant slaloms.
