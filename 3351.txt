1 The Swiss industrial group Von Roll AG reported Monday an increase in sales and orders in 1994.
2 The group, which has undergone a restructuring program in the face of heavy losses, also said it expects a substantial profit in 1995.
3 Group sales rose by 2.3 percent to Swiss francs 2.02 billion (dlrs 1.55 billion) last year from 1.98 billion francs (dlrs 1.52 billion) the year before, the company said.
4 Orders rose nearly 7 percent to just over Swiss francs 2 billion (dlrs 1.5 billion) over last year, it said.
5 The company linked the upswing to restructuring measures, higher productivity and a growing demand in Europe.
6 Von Rolls AG is a diversified Swiss technology company with interests in steel, environmental technology and wiring.
7 At the end of last year shareholders approved a restructuring plan after the company warned it would otherwise have to file for bankruptcy.
8 Von Roll reported a loss of 321.3 million francs (dlrs 246.2 million) in the first nine months of 1994 after a loss for all of 1993 of 441 million francs (dlrs 339.2 million).
