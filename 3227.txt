1 A body with three bullets in its head found in an eastern beach town was identified Wednesday as that of a Mexican book distributor who disappeared from his San Juan office last week.
2 The Institute of Forensic Medicine said the body found on a little-used highway in the town of Fajardo Tuesday was that of Guillermo Munoz Romero, 45. He was general manager of the Puerto Rican office of the Fernandez Editores book company of Mexico.
3 The institute based its conclusion on an identification by relatives of the victim who traveled here from Mexico.
4 Police said they found the body after receiving two anonymous phone calls, one reporting gunshots near the highway, the second reporting a dead body on the road.
5 Pathologist Maria Conte said Munoz Romero was killed only shortly before he was found.
6 His body will be sent to his homeland for burial, said Roberto Febres, the family's lawyer.
7 The FBI, which was investigating Munoz Romero's Jan. 31 disappearance, will investigate his slaying, spokesman Andy Guzman said.
8 The newspaper El Nuevo Dia reported Tuesday that Munoz Romero's kidnappers had demanded a $500,000 ransom from his family and employer. Guzman wouldn't comment on the report.
9 Masked, heavily armed kidnappers took Munoz Romero from his office in a guarded office park in western San Juan.
10 The kidnappers also fatally shot Alberto Morales Matos, 35, a Puerto Rican sales executive for the book company. They shot and injured Benjamin Ocasio Duran, a 50-year-old warehouse employee.
11 Police who searched Munoz Romero's apartment in San Juan's upscale tourist district found it in disarray and said items were missing. Police found his car in Fajardo, two to three miles from where his body was later discovered.
