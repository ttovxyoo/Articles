1 A delegation of U.S. State Department officials left North Korea Saturday after talks on exchanging liaison offices with the isolated communist state, the North's official media reported.
2 The exchange of offices is part of the Oct. 21 U.S.-North Korea deal in which the North agreed to freeze its nuclear program in exchange for economic aid and limited diplomatic ties.
3 During their five-day visit to Pyongyang, the North's capital, the U.S. officials looked at possible site for the American office.
4 Pyongyang's official Korea Central News Agency did not provide further details in its one-sentence dispatch monitored Sunday.
5 Liaison offices would be the first step toward normalizing relations. The United States fought in the 1950-53 Korean War on South Korea's side.
6 South Korea is urging Washington not to improve ties with Pyongyang before it improves relations with its southern capitalist rival.
7 Improving ties with the South is also part of the North's commitments under the nuclear deal, but North Korea has stalled official talks with Seoul, which it argues is a U.S. colony.
