1 As foreign ministers of Israel and its peace partners prepared to meet in Washington, the leaders Syria and Lebanon met Sunday and conveyed a message: There will be no peace without them.
2 The warning came in Syria's official media as Syrian President Hafez Assad and his Lebanese counterpart Elias Hrawi met for a second day. Their countries are the only two nations on Israel's border that have not made peace with the Jewish state.
3 The Washington meeting has triggered fears in Syria and Lebanon that the two countries could be dropped from the peace process.
4 'No peace can be realized in the region without the participation of both Syria and Lebanon,' said the Tishrin daily in an editorial.
5 'This, however, requires . the full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and south Lebanon,' it added.
6 Syrian and Lebanese peace talks with Israel have foundered over the Golan Heights, which Israel conquered in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
7 Israel also occupies a border strip in south Lebanon designed to protect against incursions by guerrillas, who allegedly operate with Damascus' backing.
8 Details of the Syrian-Lebanese summit were not disclosed. The two leaders meet regularly in Damascus to discuss both foreign policy and the internal affairs of Lebanon.
9 Syria, with at least 40,000 troops stationed in Lebanon, is the supreme arbiter there.
10 Al-Baath, organ of the ruling Baath party, accused Israel of using allegations of terrorism to pressure Syria and Lebanon into making concessions on their rights and lands.
11 'Israel, which seeks to enhance its image before the whole world, is stepping up its anti-Syria accusations, playing on the trump of terrorism charges to continue its evasion from peace,' it said.
12 In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is hosting the talks with the foreign ministers of Israel, Jordan, Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
