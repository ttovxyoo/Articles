1 After a day without soccer, officials and fans kicked around the results Monday. The conclusion: More must be done to control violence.
2 'At least we've started doing something about it. Our efforts will continue, but it is indispensable that the government and parliament make some decisions without which we will be defenseless in the face of violence,' said Mario Pescante, president of Italy's Olympic Committee.
3 And while the 'ultras' -- the Italian equivalent of British hooligans -- pledged to give up their arms, their violent language suggested that tensions would continue.
4 'Enough with the fad of 20 against two or three, or of molotov cocktails and knives,' said a statement read by one of the hundreds of ultras who participated at a rally in Genoa on Sunday.
5 Italian authorities called off Sunday's soccer league matches and other professional sports in response to the Jan. 29 stabbing death of a fan before the Genoa-AC Milan game. A 19-year-old Milan supporter was charged with the slaying, which touched off demands to crack down on violent fans.
6 'Let's teach our youth that losing (a soccer game) is a right, not a crime,' said Arrigo Sacchi, Italy's national team coach.
7 But not everyone was in favour of Sunday's ban.
8 La Gazzetta dello Sport, a major sports daily, dedicated a two-page spread to demonstrate the positive force of soccer.
9 'Soccer is Joy,' said the pages' banner headline.
10 The ban forced Italians to try other activities and reflect on the violence. Some walked their dogs in the park, others strolled aimlessly outside the empty stadiums.
11 'We can make it without (soccer) goals, but it's so hard,' said an editorial in La Repubblica.
