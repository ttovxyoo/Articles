1 Seven of the world's top players will battle for supremacy on the hard courts of the Aviation Club at the dlrs 1 million Dubai Tennis Open beginning Monday.
2 This third tournament, to run to Feb. 12, has attracted Wimbledon finalist and world No. 5 Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, seeded No. 2, with world No. 4 and French Open champion Sergi Bruguera as top seed.
3 Bruguera was defeated in the finals last year by Sweden's Magnus Gustaffson. Bruguera went on to retain his title in the French Open.
4 With two other victories in Gstaad and Prague, Bruguera earned his No. 4 ranking, making him the first Spaniard since the legendary Manuel Orantes in 1976 to finish in the top 10 for two consecutive years.
5 Fiercely patriotic, the 23-year-old Ivanisevic makes his debut with 63 wins and over dlrs 2 million in prize money.
6 Alberto Berasategui, world No. 7 and No. 3 seed, was not particularly well known when he chose to play in Marseilles this time last year, and was beaten in the first round. He arrives in Dubai as the French Open runner-up, winner of seven titles in 1994, and a member of the world's top 10.
7 World No. 18 Thomas Muster, seeded fifth, will be making his third bid for the Dubai title. The Austrian No. 1 again finished the year in the top 20, with three titles under his belt.
8 The Czech Republic's Petr Korda, world No. 19 and No. 6 seed, is another player who makes a welcome return to Dubai, where he reached the quarterfinal on his debut in 1994.
9 Korda comes to Dubai having reached three finals during the past year, as well as finishing as a doubles finalist in Moscow with Boris Becker.
10 Australian Jason Stoltenberg, world No. 22, is another familiar face from last year's event, as is Italian Andrea Gaudenzi, world No. 24. Gaudenzi is back this year, after falling to Korda at the first hurdle in 1994.
