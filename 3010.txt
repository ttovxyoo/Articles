1 Just 17 days after being released from a rehabilitation clinic, Arsenal striker Paul Merson was cleared to play in Wednesday night's Super Cup match against AC Milan.
2 The decision was announced by the Football Association following a phone call from Arsenal manager George Graham, who lobbied for Merson to be allowed to play.
3 'We need Paul Merson back,' Graham said earlier. 'We need his quality and thought.'
4 Merson, a former England striker, said he was ready to return for his first game since Oct. 26.
5 'I feel good and I believe I can be like a new signing for the club,' he said. 'I'm a completely different person to the one that went into the addiction clinic.'
6 Merson disclosed in a newspaper interview late last year that he had been addicted to alcohol, cocaine and gambling. The FA ordered him to get treatment and he spent six weeks in a clinic.
7 Since his release on Jan. 13, Merson has been training with Arsenal and waiting for the FA's authorization to play again.
8 'Following his success in in-patient rehabilitation in the addiction clinic he has, to date, complied with everything asked of him in his out-patient rehabilitation phase,' the FA said in a statement.
9 'The FA have received several reports from his medical specialists which include attendance at his local support groups for his problems with alcohol and gambling.
10 'In addition to this Paul Merson has been subjected to two specific target tests for drugs and alcohol and both proved to be negative.
11 'The player and Arsenal have been made fully aware he will be subject to random target tests for drugs and alcohol over the next 18 months.'
12 Wednesday night's match pits the winners of last year's Champions Cup and the Cup Winners Cup.
