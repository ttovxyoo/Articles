1 Portugal's Paulo Guerra outsprinted Kenyan Ondoro Osoro Sunday to win the Almond Blossom Cross Country, stretch his lead in the IAAF standings and clinch the European Club Champions' Cup for his team Maratona.
2 Guerra, 24, completed the 10,000 meter race in 29 minutes, 21 seconds, just two seconds ahead of the Kenyan, a three-time winner in the Algarve race.
3 The victory extended Guerra's lead in the IAAF standings to 100 points from four meets after 10 events of the World Cross Country Challenge.
4 It also clinched the 32nd European Club Champion's Cup for Guerra's team, Maratona-Portugal, ahead of defending champions Sporting Lisbon and Spain's Reebok.
5 But the athlete showed his usual modest form after the race.
6 'I'm highly satisfied,' he said. 'But I don't want you to think too much of me, I'm only 24 and I'll try to keep my good form for the world championships, but don't turn me into a champion prematurely.'
7 Domingos Castro and Joaquim Pinheiro of Portugal came in third and fourth with times of 29:37 and 29:48 ahead of Morocco's Riad Mohamed with 29:53 and Kenya's James Kariuki with 29:57.
8 Kariuki's 15 points for sixth spot gave him a points total of 72 from four meets, enough to vault him past Moroccan Salah Hissou to tie with Kenya's Ismael Kirui in second overall in the IAAF standings.
9 Hissou has 60 points from three meets.
10 Gabriela Szabo of Romania, a winner earlier this month in Auchan, France, picked up her second straight victory by easing out local favorite Fernanda Ribeiro in the 6,000-meter women's event.
11 Szabo also sprinted hard to the line to finish in 19:31, two seconds ahead of Ribeiro. The Romanian's win sent her soaring up the IAAF standings from 24th equal to joint seventh with Kenya's Helen Kimaiyo on 50 points.
12 Ribeiro's 22 points from second place also helped her rise in the standings from sixth to fourth with 69 points from three meets.
13 Britain's Paula Radcliffe placed third behind Ribeiro, followed by Kenya's Tecla Lorupe and Joyce Chepchumba. Radcliffe moved up from 13th to sixth in the Challenge standings with 55 points from three meets.
