1 Dutchman Rintje Ritmsa won his first-ever World Speedskating Championship Sunday after a season dominating the field.
2 Ritsma, 24, twice European Championships and Olympic silver medalist in Lillehammer, won seven World Cup races this season but had yet to win a World Championship.
3 He showed his talent as an all-round skater Sunday, winning both the 1,500- and the 10,000-meters. He finished third in the 500- and fifth in the 5,000 races on Saturday.
4 'I skated one of my best 10 kilometers today. It was really good. I was able to keep a steady pace of 34 seconds a lap so I was always in control of the race,' said Ritsma who finished with a time of 14 minutes, 9.89 seconds.
5 'I was very surprised and nervous for the 1,500 because I saw the other times were fast. This gave me the motivation to push even harder though,' he said.
6 Ritsma complained about the snowy and foggy conditions Saturday and said he skated much better Sunday when weather was better.
7 Japan's Keiji Shirahata, 21, finished second in both the 10,000-meter and the overall, earning a total of 161.86 points to Ritsma's 160.99. He broke his personal best in the 10,000 covering the distance in a time of 14:14.16.
8 'I didn't expect it. It's the result of many years of hard work,' said Shirahata.
9 Roberto Sighel of Italy, the 1992 World Champion in Calgary, finished third overall with 162.85 points.
10 American Dave Tamburrino skated the race of his career performing well in all four events and ending up fifth overall.
11 His best result to date in the World Championship was 24th last year.
12 'If someone would have told me--hey, you're going to be fifth in the Worlds--I would have said `you're crazy',' said the 22-year-old Tamburrino.
13 'When I was a kid I used to watch (Johann) Koss and Falko (Zandstra) and all those guys. It's hard to believe I'm starting to rise in the ranks a little bit,' said Tamburrino who is from Saratoga Springs, N.Y.
14 Tamburrino said he changed over from short-track speedskating to long-track in 1990 and the results have followed.
15 Canada's Neal Marshall excelled in the 1,500-meter, his best event, to finish third. Marshall has won two World Cup races in the event so far this season.
16 Marshall, 25, moved up from 12th position after Saturday's races to 10th overall.
17 'I'm happy. All year long I've been hoping to get into the top three in the 1,500,' said Marshall.
18 'My first goal was to get into the top three in 1,500, my second was to make the cut (top 12 after three races) and I did both,' said Marhshall.
19 Misfortune hit Dutchman Falko Zandstra, one of the race favorites since he finished second to Ritsma in the European Championships this year.
20 He skated powerfully through the first three laps to post the fasted interval time, but as he approached the final corner, Zandstra fell and skidded off the track.
21 'My arm band was going down my arm and then it suddenly fell off. I put my skate on it and fell,' said a disappointed Zanstra.
22 KC Boutiette, the only other U.S. competitor, and Canada's Kevin Marshall did not qualify for the 10,000-meter race.
