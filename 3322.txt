1 European champion Rintje Ritmsa won the 1,500-meter event in the Men's World Speedskating Championships Sunday, securing his lead in the overall standings.
2 The Olympic silver medalist completed the race in 1 minute, 53.31 seconds, more than two seconds slower than the World Record, but well below the Baselga track record of 1 minute, 54.58.
3 Ritsma, 24, added the victory to his third place in the 500-meters and his fifth in the 5,000 to give him a total of 118.49 points before the final 10,000-meter event, which was set for late afternoon.
4 Keiji Sirahata of Japan finished second with a time of 1:53.39 and moved into the No. 2 position in the overall standings. Shirahata, 21, is ranked second in the World Cup standings for the 5,000-meter event.
5 Canada's Neal Marshall excelled in the 1,500-meter, his best event, to finish third. Marshall has won two World Cup races in the event so far this season.
6 Marshall, 25, moved up from 12th position after Saturday's races to eighth after Sunday's first event.
7 American Dave Tamburrino skated the race of his career, finishing seventh and breaking his personal best with a time of 1:54.90. He is sixth in the overall standings.
8 Misfortune hit Dutchman Falko Zandstra, one of the race favorites since he finished second to Ritsma in the European Championships this year.
9 He skated powerfully through the first three laps to post the fasted interval time, but as he approached the final corner, Zandstra fell and skidded off the track.
10 'My arm band was going down my arm and then it suddenly fell off. I put my skate on it and fell,' said a disappointed Zanstra.
11 KC Boutiette, the only other U.S. competitor, finished 17th in the 1,500-meter and holds 15th place overall.
12 Canada's Kevin Marshall placed 19th.
