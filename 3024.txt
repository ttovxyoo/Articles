1 A radio station has apologized for asking listeners to call in Auschwitz jokes on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp.
2 'It's an instance we would like to put behind us,' Beverly Rice, general manager of WDEZ-AM, said after the station was contacted by the Chicago-based Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights groups that fights anti-Semitism.
3 An announcer who goes by the name Terry T. suggested during his morning show Friday that the country music station's listeners phone in Auschwitz jokes. He broadcast an apology Monday.
4 Friday marked the anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps at Auschwitz in southern Poland where 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, were killed during World War II.
5 Michael Sandberg, Midwest civil rights director for the Anti-Defamation League, said the league was told about Terry T.'s remarks by non-Jewish people in Wausau.
6 'We were appalled. It's not a joking matter,' he said Tuesday. 'To many people around the world, Jews and gentiles alike, what happened at Auschwitz represents cruelty and tragedy. We did not believe it to be an appropriate subject for jokes.'
7 Sandberg said his group planned no other action against the radio station following the broadcast of the apology.
8 Terry T. declined to comment further about the matter.
