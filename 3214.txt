1 Russian lawmakers on Wednesday demanded greater security for government officials, as mourners gathered at a funeral service for the third deputy to be killed in the past 10 months.
2 Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, proposed creating a special parliamentary security service.
3 Rybkin's announcement came after ultranationalist deputy Vladimir Zhirinovsky called for the speaker's resignation for failing to protect legislators.
4 The previous Russian parliament had its own security service, but President Boris Yeltsin disbanded the service -- along with the parliament itself -- in October 1993, after a parliamentary uprising.
5 Legislators have become frequent targets of violence in Russia, and many now carry weapons or have bodyguards.
6 The body of Sergei Skorochkin, an independent Duma deputy, was found by Moscow police on Feb. 2. He had been kidnapped and shot in the back of the head.
7 The 33-year-old Skorochkin, who also ran a private business in Zaraisk, shocked parliament last summer when he shot and killed a man who allegedly opened fire on him. A passerby also was killed in the shootout.
8 In November, Communist Party deputy Valentin Martemyanov died after he was beaten and robbed by unknown assailants.
9 Lawmaker Andrei Aizderdzis was shot and killed last April on the doorstep of his Moscow home. Fellow lawmakers believe it was a gangland slaying because Aizderdzis published a newspaper that printed the names of reputed organized crime figures.
