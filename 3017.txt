2 The National Association of Purchasing Managers said Wednesday its index of manufacturing growth rose to 57.9 percent in January from 57.5 percent in December. The index has been advancing for the last year and a half.
3 An index reading above 50 percent indicates an expansion of activity at the nation's factories, while a reading below 50 percent indicates a decline.
4 Production and new orders increased but as the same rate of growth as December, the report said.
5 In a troubling sign of inflation, more firms reported paying higher prices for raw materials in January. The survey said 73 percent of respondants paid higher prices compared to 71 percent in December.
