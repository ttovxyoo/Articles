1 Spain's Santiago Luna shot a 5-under-par 67 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead after the first round of the dlrs 395,000 Madeira Island Open.
2 Six players were one stroke back and 68 and eight others were two strokes off the lead at 69. Fifty-two players shot par or better on a spring-like day with little or no wind.

4 Scotland's Andrew Coltart headed a group of eight at 69.
5 Defending champion Mats Lanner of Sweden couldn't take advantage of the low-scoring conditions and posted a 10-over 82.
6 Luna had seven birdies and with two bogeys and was satisfied with his play.
7 'The golf course is in good condition, but the greens are very fast, a bit dangerous,' he said.
8 The tournament -- the third this season on the PGA European tour but the first in Europe -- is being played on the hilly par-72, 6,606-yard (6,039 meter) Madeira Golf Club, located on a volcanic Portuguese island group situated 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) southwest of Lisbon.
