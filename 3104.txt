1 A federal jury awarded dlrs 6 million Friday to a woman whose breast implants ruptured, spreading silicone throughout her body.
2 Brenda Toole had been seeking dlrs 13 million from Baxter Healthcare Corp., which purchased the implant maker, Heyer-Schulte, in 1986.
3 Mrs. Toole got the implants in 1981 and they ruptured eight years later. Since then, she has had three operations to remove silicone from her body.
4 Doctors testified that potentially cancerous lumps had developed around her breasts and that her immune system was damaged.
5 'When you injure people like this, you've got to pay for it,' Mrs. Toole's lawyer, Ralph Knowles, told the jury Thursday in closing arguments.
6 But Baxter lawyer Debra Pole told jurors that doctors knew about the dangers of implants and that Mrs. Toole gave them permission for the surgery.
7 The jury deliberated two days. Mrs. Toole, a 43-year-old librarian from Dothan, burst into tears when the verdict was read.
8 Lawyers for Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter refused comment.
9 Mrs. Toole had been awarded dlrs 2.2 million in 1993, but the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set it aside, saying a Food and Drug Administration report critical of implants should not have been allowed as evidence.
10 Mrs. Toole's case was one of thousands of breast implant lawsuits consolidated in Birmingham in 1992 under U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer.
11 Many of the cases have been included in a dlrs 4.2 billion settlement with implant makers. However, hundreds of women, including Mrs. Toole, decided to have their cases tried separately.
