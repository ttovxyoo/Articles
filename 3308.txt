1 A British government minister resigned on Saturday, as tensions in the governing Conservative Party increased over Britain's policy on Europe.
2 The Sunday Express newspaper reported that Charles Wardle, a junior minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, resigned because he felt Britain was endangered by a possible flood of immigrants as relations with Europe became closer.
3 Wardle himself was not available for comment, although a statement from Prime Minister John Major's office confirmed Wardle's resignation.
4 Wardle, a former Immigration Minister, was quoted in the Sunday Express as saying that his resignation was prompted by moves in some fellow European Community member countries to erase international borders.
5 Britain signed an 'opt-out' agreement with its partners in the European Community in 1985 which allows it out of any agreement to devolve borders. But the Express claimed that an 1991 internal government report said that the agreement was poorly worded, and easily challenged in the European Court.
6 Wardle's resignation came on the same day that the influential former party chairman, Lord Tebbit, told a Young Conservatives conference that he would advocate civil disobedience against the enforcement of European laws.
7 Major has faced increasing internal party opposition to bringing Britain closer to Europe. Last week, Conservative 'Eurosceptics' slammed him for not committing himself against a single European currency, although he has said he has deep misgivings about the idea.
8 It was the second resignation from Major's embattled minority government in a week. Earlier, Allan Stewart, a junior minister in the Scottish Office, stepped down after reports that he scuffled with demonstrators protesting the expansion of roads.
