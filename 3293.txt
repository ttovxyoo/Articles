1 A British organization is entering the legal battle over smoking, a decision that eventually might involve controversial Brown and Williamson Corp. documents on smoking and health.
2 The Legal Aid Board for London agreed last week to help pay the legal fees for 200 low-income people with lung cancer and other smoking-related illnesses who are seeking to sue cigarette companies for damages.
3 Anti-smoking activists in England say the 4,000 pages of leaked Brown and Williamson documents will be instrumental in future cases against the cigarette companies, The Courier-Journal of Louisville reported Friday.
4 Brown and Williamson said the documents were stolen from its Louisville offices by a former legal-firm employee and has been fighting to keep the documents from being used against them in lawsuits.
5 Several U.S. news organizations obtained copies of the documents, which they said showed Brown and Williamson executives knew at least 30 years ago nicotine was addictive and hid potentially damaging information from the public.
6 British lawyers have been trying for three years to get legal aid for smokers' lawsuits. To receive government financial help, claimants must meet strict financial requirements and must convince a local board of lawyers that there are reasonable grounds for a case.
7 The Legal Aid Board said the claimants showed they had reasonable grounds for their claims. They alleged that the cigarette companies failed to meet their legal duty to minimize the risks of smoking and that they took steps to undermine scientific and medical warnings against smoking.
8 B.A.T Industries PLC, the London-based parent company of Brown and Williamson, said it would not comment on the Legal Aid Board's ruling to help fund smokers' lawsuits until it could review the decision. The company noted, however, that the decision does not mean the smokers' complaints will result in a court case.
