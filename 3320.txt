1 Energy Minister Gonen Segev said Sunday he was investigating ways to resume oil transport to Gaza, suspended after Palestinian gunmen attacked an Israeli tanker and killed a security guard last week.
2 The gas resources of the autonomous Gaza Strip have been depleted by the closure clamped on it, along with the West Bank, after a suicide bombing attack in central Israel that killed 21 Israelis three weeks ago.
3 Palestinian officials said Sunday that they had only enough benzene to last two days.
4 The Israeli oil tanker entered Gaza on Feb. 6 as part of a government decision to ease the closure. After the attack, restrictions were reimposed.
5 'We have a little gas,' said Palestinian Economics Minister Ahmed Qurei. 'We will import from abroad, from Jordan and Egypt. We don't need the Israeli gasoline.'
6 But Segev said imports from Jordan and Egypt were not an immediate solution.
7 Jordan would have to import through Israel, creating more security problems, and a special terminal would have to be set up between Gaza and Egypt before gas tanks could pass, Segev said.
8 Segev proposed instead that Israeli tankers transfer their load to Palestinian tractor-trailers at the Erez crossing point.
9 'This is the simplest procedure,' he said on Israel Radio. 'The supply will still be low but it is better than today's situation where . in two day's time will not be able to warm homes, run factories or fill gas tanks.'
10 Segev plans to visit Erez border crossing Monday.
