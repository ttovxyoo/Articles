1 U.S. Ambassador Victor Jackovich sought to reassure Bosnians on Friday that American policy toward the former Yugoslav republic would not change even if he is replaced.
2 Jackovich was asked by Bosnian Television about widespread speculation he was being replaced as U.S. ambassador to Bosnia, signaling a change in Washington's policy.
3 He did not directly answer, but said: 'Every ambassador serves according to the will of the U.S. president and according to the instructions of the secretary of state and other officials.'
4 'So, the question whether I will stay on one place, in Sarajevo, or whether I should go somewhere else, is not my decision. It is the decision of my superiors,' Jackovich said, speaking in Serbo-Croatian by telephone from Washington.
5 'As far as I am concerned that doesn't mean a change in U.S. policy on Bosnia. We will see that anybody who takes the position, and I still have it, will continue the policy toward your country.'
6 Jackovich was recalled to Washington last week for consultations, as the United States announced it would open direct dialogue with the Bosnian Serbs, which Jackovich rejected as contrary to existing U.S. policy.
7 U.S. officials have repeatedly blamed Bosnian Serbs for starting the war in 1992, and former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger named several as possible war criminals.
8 American sources speaking on condition of anonymity say Jackovich has been offered the ambassadorship to Slovenia, another former Yugoslav republic. One said the 46-year-old career diplomat accepted the much-lower profile position as a way of remaining in the region where he has worked for two decades.
