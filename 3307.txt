3 Holy Bull, running with Cigar, was pulled up by jockey Mike Smith in mid-backstretch. Smith then dismounted before the half-mile (800-meter) pole.
4 Holy Bull remained on his feet and then was loaded onto a horse ambulance, but did so reluctantly.
5 Holy Bull was making his second start of the year and was bidding for his seventh straight victory.
6 He went off at odds of 1-5 against eight rivals at the track where eight days shy of one year ago he suffered the first defeat of his career, when he had a slipped pallete and finished sixth in the Fountain of Youth.
7 Saturday's defeat was the third in 12 starts for the strapping gray colt, owned and trained by Jimmy Croll.
