1 While voters turned out in impressive numbers for the first post-independence parliamentary elections in Kyrgyzstan, they elected only 13 of 105 deputies, news agencies said Monday.
2 The Central Asian republic will hold a second round of elections on Feb. 19 to fill the remaining 92 seats, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
3 In Sunday's elections, 72.8 percent of the 2.2 million registered voters cast their ballots, but a glut of candidates had many predicting runoffs.
4 More than 1,000 candidates from 12 parties and dozens of movements are competing for seats in the bicameral parliament, the Jogorku Kenesh. There are an average of 10 candidates per seat, with as many as 18 vying for some seats in the capital, Bishkek.
5 Among the 13 elected Sunday in the former Soviet republic were acclaimed writer Chingiz Aitmatov and two prominent former Communist Party leaders, ITAR-Tass said.
6 Kyrgyzstan's earlier parliament was dissolved last fall in a government crisis.
7 In September, 168 legislators who accused their parliamentary leaders of 'intrigues' forced a suspension of parliament and the resignation of the government.
8 Kyrgyzstan, with a population of 4.5 million, has experienced serious problems trying to develop a market economy but still has one of the more prosperous ones in former Soviet Central Asia. Its president, Askar Akayev, had been known as the most democratic leader in the region until parliament's suspension.
9 'Thos who accused me of dictatorship and lack of democracy can see that democracy lives on in Kyrgyzstan,' Akaev told the Interfax news agency Monday.
