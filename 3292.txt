1 Russian officials on Friday confirmed that Moscow had agreed to supply China with four submarines, but denied the deal could upset the balance of power in Asia.
2 The Interfax news agency quoted an unidentified Russian navy official as saying the first Kilo-class diesel submarine had been built but not delivered.
3 On Thursday, Robert Karniol, the Asia-Pacific editor for Jane's Defense Weekly magazine, said the $1 billion deal was signed in November and that the first sub was being shipped to China.
4 Karniol said Moscow's decision to sell China 'their most advanced systems' was 'a new development and very worrisome' to China's neighbors.
5 The submarines, which have sophisticated search and attack sonars, could be used to blockade Taiwan, which China considers part of its territory.
6 The Russian officer dismissed the concern and accused the United States of 'raising a fuss,' Interfax said.
7 Russia launched its Kilo program in 1979. According to Jane's Fighting Ships, it has exported Kilo-class submarines to Poland, Romania and Algeria.
