1 Russia shut out Canada's team of minor league players 6-0 Saturday to set up a title game against Sweden in the Sweden Hockey Games.
2 Sweden, 2-0 in the four-team tournament, only needs a tie in Sunday's finale to win the tournament. The Russians, 1-0-1, must beat the Swedes to finish atop the standings.
3 'It was a humiliating loss,' Canadian coach Tom Renney after his team's second straight setback. 'I'm certainly disappointed in my team's performance and I'm disappointed on behalf of the fans who came to watch Canada play.'
4 Dmitri Denisov gave the Russians a 1-0 lead just 2:45 into the game on the power play with Michael Burkett off for tripping. Oleg Belov made it 2-0 at 7:12 with a shorthanded goal.
5 'We were never able to rebound after they scored in the early stages of the game,' Renney said. 'I guess that's a testimony to a young, inexperienced, international team that's learning about adversity.'
6 Sergei Fokin, the only player on the Russian team who's based in Sweden, Rafik Yakubov, Ravil Yakubov and Anatoli Emelin scored the other goals for Russia.
7 The winless Canadians, who lost in the first round to Sweden 7-4, needs to beat the Czech Republic Sunday to avoid last place in the standings.
8 'We really have to play much better tomorrow to maintain any kind of credibility in this competition,' Renney said. 'You can be assured that we'll be prepared and we'll certainly make every attempt to make amends for our poor performance today.'
