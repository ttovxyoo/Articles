1 Six endangered California condors were moved to holding pens in a remote forest canyon Wednesday to prepare them for their release into the wild.
2 The large birds -- four females and two males -- were transported from the Los Angeles Zoo to a site in Los Padres National Forest in Santa Barbara County. They are to be released Feb. 8, and three condors now living in the wild are to be returned to captivity.
3 The six birds will bring to 19 the number released through the California Condor Recovery Program since 1992, although only three are in the wild now.
4 Four died after hitting power lines and one died after ingesting antifreeze. Five were returned to captivity after straying too close to power lines.
5 The other three will be returned to captivity so they don't lead the new birds to hazardous areas, officials said.
6 The six condors moved Wednesday were trained at the zoo to avoid power lines and be wary of people, said Mike Wallace, leader of the condor recovery team.
7 'The conditioning program has had good results so far in the zoo,' he said. 'The big question is whether the birds will adequately transfer these behaviors to the field.'
8 Plans are under way to condition and release seven more condors later this year.
9 The are 88 California condors in existence, more than three times the number when captive breeding programs began more than a decade ago.
