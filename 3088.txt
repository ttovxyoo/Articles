1 It's been seven years since France beat England in rugby union, but that hasn't lessened the intensity of the cross-Channel rivalry.
2 On Saturday, the two teams meet at Twickenham in the game that is expected to decide this year's Five Nations Championship. The buildup has been anything but congenial.
3 'Playing against France in the Five Nations is like facing 15 Eric Cantonas,' said England front row forward Brian Moore, referring to the French and Manchester United soccer player who attacked a spectator during a game last week. 'They are brilliant, but brutal.'
4 Players like Moore, nicknamed 'Pit Bull' by his England teammates, revel in the atmosphere of the France-England games. Last year, he was accused by French coach Pierre Berbizier of orchestrating on-field provocations of the French players, whose succession of penalties resulted in an 18-14 defeat.
5 Memories of that loss are just some of the many frustrations that have motivated French captain Philippe Saint-Andre for this year's game.
6 'We've not won for six years,' Saint-Andre said. 'I don't say we've got an inferiority complex, but we do tend to let them dictate the way the game is played. We have got to stamp our authority on the match for a change.'
7 Saint-Andre and his teammates are particularly bothered that the French were pressured into dropping Olivier Merle for the game for his head-butt of Ricky Evans in the opener against Wales, while Ben Clarke has been retained by England despite receiving a yellow card for stamping on Simon Geoghegan in its game at Ireland.
8 'Let's just say we sometimes feel there are double standards involved in eliminating foul play,' Saint-Andre said. 'It certainly gives us an added incentive for winning at Twickenham.'
9 England can attribute its winning streak over France to a brutal, forward-led attack that has capitalized on the opponent's lack of discipline. In last year's victory at Parc des Princes, for example, England won without scoring a try and 15 of the 18 points came off penalties.
10 This year, however, England has changed its tactics, emphasizing a flowing attack led by the backs. England's three tries against Ireland were more than it scored in the entire competition last year.
11 England manager Jack Rowell said he offered England's players the chance to go back to the kick-and-maul style against France, but they declined.
12 'The squad wants to stick to what we are trying to play -- more dynamic, handling rugby,' Rowell said.
13 France has always preferred the wide-open style, so Saturday's game could produce plenty of tries. But Berbizier still isn't convinced.
14 'In the past . we grew impatient and forgot the basics,' he said. 'We have to remember we cannot rely on French flair to pull us through.'
15 With the exception of Olivier Brouzet replacing Merle in the French pack, both lineups are basically unchanged from the teams that won handily two weeks ago, England 20-8 over Ireland and France 21-9 over Wales.
16 Saturday's other game pits Scotland and Ireland at Murrayfield. Scottish captain Gavin Hastings rebuffed suggestions that the two clubs, plus Wales, had sunk to the level where they could be referred to as the 'second division' of the Five Nations.
17 'I do not support the idea there are two divisions in the Five Nations,' said Hastings, who will break the Scottish record for international appearances as he takes the field for the 53rd time.
18 Scotland broke a 10-match winless streak when it beat Canada 22-6 in a Test match two weeks ago, while Ireland's loss to England would have been a rout if the English hadn't squandered three sure tries.
