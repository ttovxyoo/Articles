1 A German veteran of World War II believes an unexploded Soviet bomb still lies underground on Russian writer Lev Tolstoy's estate, a newspaper said Wednesday.
2 Former Wehrmacht soldier Heinrich Heym has written Russian authorities warning that the bomb lies buried on the Yasnaya Polyana estate, a popular tourist attraction 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Moscow, the English-language Moscow Times reported.
3 In a letter to the Russian Embassy in Bonn, Heym said his unit was billeted in Yasnaya Polyana in late 1941 as Adolf Hitler's troops advanced on Moscow. He said Soviet planes dropped a bomb, which struck Tolstoy's house without going off and fell to the ground.
4 'It lay there for two days and then we dug a hole and buried it,' Heym said in a telephone interview with The Moscow Times.
5 'Of course I can't remember all the details, but I remember the case quite clearly. I think the bomb is still there,' he said.
6 Heym's letter was turned over to officials in Tula, near Yasnaya Polyana. A team of engineers sent to search for the bomb located a metal object underground but were unable to say if it was a bomb.
7 'The earth is frozen and we cannot start digging until April,' Nikolai Begunkov, head of Tula's Emergency Committee, told the newspaper. He said there was no danger even if it were a bomb.
8 Tolstoy, the author of 'War and Peace' and 'Anna Karenina,' was born at Yasnaya Polyana in 1828 and lived there much of his life. The estate was turned into a museum and nature reserve in 1921.
