1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Andrey Olhovskiy survived an early scare but came back to win Saturday's doubles match and qualify Russia for the next round of the Davis Cup at Belgium's expense.
2 Kafelnikov and Olhovskiy beat Libor Pimek and Filip Dewulf 2-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-3 in 2 1/2 hours, giving Russia an insurmountable 3-0 lead after two days of play.
3 Sunday's reverse singles will be reduced to the best-of-three format because the match is already out of Belgium's reach.
4 On Friday, veteran Andrei Chesnokov beat Dewulf in straight sets and Kafelnikov was surprisingly hard pressed early on before prevailing over Kris Goossens in four sets.
5 On Saturday, Russia, last year's losing finalist against Sweden, was again caught cold early on.
6 Olhovskiy could not get his serve in and Kafelnikov was still looking for his touch by the time Belgium had wrapped up the first set in 25 minutes on the slow clay of the Arena hall here.
7 Belgium also broke serve first in the second set. But with the sense that an upset win was possible came the pressure and nerves.
8 Olhovskiy was slowly working himself into the match and Pimek gave up the decisive service game to put the sides level.
9 The 1,500 fans still had a chance to cheer in the third set, when Belgium raced to a 5-3 lead. But again, the Russian duo rose to the occasion and won four games in succession.
10 They never looked back in the fourth set.
