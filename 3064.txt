1 After three days of talks in Washington, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic arrived in Moscow on Thursday to confer with Russian officials on settling the Bosnia conflict.
2 Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin said Silajdzic's two-day working visit was part of Russia's efforts to bring an end to the 34-month war in the former Yugoslavia.
3 Karasin told the ITAR-Tass news agency that Silajdzic will meet with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev to discuss the Bosnian peace plan put together by five Western countries.
4 Russia's historical ally in the Balkans is the Serbs, fellow Orthodox Slavs.
5 In Washington, Silajdzic had held talks with Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and congressional leaders.
6 The Bosnian prime minister appeared exasperated that the Clinton administration declined to lift the U.N. Security Council arms embargo in Bosnia. He said a majority in Congress supported providing arms to Bosnian government forces.
7 In Moscow, Silajdzic was expected to press for a May 1 deadline for the Serbs to accept the peace plan worked out by the so-called Contact Group: the United States, Russia, France, England and Germany.
8 Under the peace plan, Muslims and Croats would control 51 percent of Bosnia. Bosnian Serbs have rejected the plan, which would give them the remaining 49 percent, about one-third less than they have captured in the war.
