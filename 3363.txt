1 The U.S. dollar edged lower against the Japanese yen Tuesday, and prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell back following two trading days of gains.
2 At 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT), the dollar was trading at 98.75 yen, down 0.12 yen from late Monday trading in Tokyo and also slightly below its overnight New York level of 98.76 yen.
3 The dollar remained within a narrow range as investors refrained from taking any big moves in either direction ahead of U.S. economic reports to be released later in the week. The reports could provide clues to the future of the economy and inflation.
