1 An 'exasperated' President Clinton summoned players and owners to the White House this evening after a mediator failed to make any progress in settling the 179-day U.S. Major League Baseball strike.
2 Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and several White House aides met with mediator W.J. Usery for 35 minutes in the Oval Office. Usery brought with him an outline on how to resolve the dispute, but did not disclose those plans.
3 With spring training supposed to start in only nine days, Usery also brought news that players and owners were no closer to a resolution.
4 'The president was exasperated that there was no progress toward settling the baseball strike,' said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
5 Clinton responded by ordering representatives of players and owners to the White House for a meeting at 6 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) to stress the need for a settlement, McCurry said.
6 Clinton had set a Monday deadline for resolving the dispute, but the sides ignored his call and have not talked for three days.
7 'The deadline has passed, and we are now into a different course of action,' McCurry said.
8 'The purpose of this (6 p.m.) session is not to negotiate further,' he said.
9 It was not clear what course of action either Clinton could pursue. There was speculation that Usery's terms could be used as special legislation to impose a settlement, but congressional leaders said today they didn't think the solution to the strike would be found on Capitol Hill.
10 There was talk that Usery could recommend binding arbitration. Players had indicated they might accept the process, although owners were less likely to favor that.
