1 Switzerland's Supreme Court approved on Thursday the extradition of the grandson of former Communist ruler Todor Zhivkov to face rape charges in Bulgaria.
2 Todor Ivanov Slavkov, 24, had appealed against being returned to Bulgaria, claiming he would be the victim of a political vendetta against his family.
3 Zhivkov is under house arrest in Sofia on charges of embezzling state funds during his rule between 1954 and the fall of Communism in 1989. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment but has yet to serve his jail term.
4 Slavkov is accused of raping a teen-age girl in 1988. Bulgarian authorities opened criminal proceedings against him after his grandfather was ousted.
5 He was arrested while studying in Switzerland in 1992 but then went underground while released on bail. He was re-arrested in May 1994 after being stopped for a traffic violation.
6 A Bulgarian police official working for the Interpol office in Sofia was mysteriously found shot dead with a bullet through his head in June 1992 while he was working on Slavkov's return from Switzerland.
7 Opposition parties in the late 1980s accused Slavkov of trying to buy U.S. citizenship with dlrs 1 million in state funds.
8 He is son of Todor Zhivkov's late daughter Lyudmila Zhivkova and his son-in-law Ivan Slavkov, the head of Bulgaria's Olympic Committee.
9 The Federal Tribunal rejected Slavkov's appeals against extradition, saying it was confident that Bulgaria would try him for the rape charges rather than for political reasons. It pointed out that Bulgaria had ratified the European human rights conventions and had given guarantees of a fair trial.
10 The court did not give a date for his extradition. It is expected in the next few days.
