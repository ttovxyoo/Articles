1 The man accused of masterminding the World Trade Center bombing is suspected of planting a bomb on a Philippine airliner that killed a passenger in December, the national police chief said Monday.
2 Director General Recaredo Sarmiento said the bombing, which killed a Japanese passenger, was 'a dry run' for a terror campaign against U.S. carriers in the Far East.
3 Ramzi Yousef, who was arrested last week in Pakistan and deported to the United States, also was involved in a plot to kill Pope John Paul II during his visit to Manila last month, Sarmiento said.
4 On Dec. 11, a bomb exploded aboard a Philippine Airlines bound for Tokyo from the central Philippine city of Cebu. The pilot landed the plane safely on Okinawa but one person was killed and five others were injured.
5 A Filipino Muslim extremist group claimed responsibility, but police doubt whether it was capable of carrying out the attack.
6 Sarmiento said the bomb was made of the same materials recovered from an apartment believed to have been rented by Yousef under the name Naji Haddad. The apartment is about 100 meters (yards) from the Vatican ambassador's residence, where the pope stayed during his Jan. 12-16 visit to Manila.
7 Authorities here say they raided the apartment Jan. 6 after a suspicious fire and discovered bomb-making materials. The man registered as Haddad escaped but another Arab was arrested.
8 Three days after the raid, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issued a security alert for all American airliners flying over the Pacific, including a ban on hand-carried liquids, aerosols and shaving cream.
