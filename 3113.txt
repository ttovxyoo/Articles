1 Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak -- who is locked in a power struggle with President Lech Walesa -- indicated Saturday he may step down.
2 Walesa and Pawlak have been feuding over the 1995 budget, over economic reforms and foreign policy.
3 Walesa, a Nobel laureate whose Solidarity trade union toppled the Communist government in 1989, is threatening to dissolve parliament to force new elections.
4 Pawlak is losing support within his own coalition, which is made up of his Polish Peasants Party and the Democratic Left Alliance. The Alliance has repeatedly accused Pawlak of making decisions behind their backs.
5 After a Friday night meeting of the Alliance, its leaders said they might call for a no-confidence vote against Pawlak.
6 'The meeting went very poorly for the prime minster,' said Jozef Oleksy, who speaker of parliament.
7 On Saturday, Pawlak indicated to reporters he might let the Alliance's national leader -- Aleksander Kwasniewski -- take over as prime minister.
8 'The question is whether Kwasniewski would accept this very important post and the responsibility that comes with it,' Pawlak said.
9 Kwasniewski is thought have his sights on Walesa's job. But he told the Polish Press Agency he would not turn down the premiership if offered.
10 Walesa was getting his own share of criticism.
11 A parliamentary women's group said Saturday they will ask that Walesa be deprived of his Nobel Peace Prize if he dissolves parliament.
12 The Sejm, parliament's lower chamber, on Saturday passed a resolution saying dissolving the legislature would be illegal and Walesa would have to face the country's supreme court if he went ahead and did it.
