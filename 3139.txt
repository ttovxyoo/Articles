1 Bosnian Croats and Muslims agreed Sunday to binding arbitration to settle disputes in their federation.
2 U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, who chaired a meeting of the two sides with international mediators, said Washington was pleased by the decision.
3 Binding arbitration was part of a nine-point plan to support the federation. Although the Bosnian Croats and Muslims are no longer fighting each other, they have made little progress toward a military and political union since Washington brokered the federation last March.
4 The arbitrator is to be appointed by mutual agreement of the two sides, and either side can bring up an issue for arbitration.
5 The agreement, which had not been hinted at in advance, came as the United States and other countries were increasingly worried that wider warfare may break out in Bosnia this spring.
6 Shoring up the federation has been a priority for mediators from the so-called Contract Group, comprising the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany.
7 With the Muslims and Croats united, they hope to pressure their enemies, the Bosnian Serbs, into accepting a peace plan.
8 Sunday's agreement makes no reference to the Serbs, who are widely deemed the major aggressors in the almost three-year-old Bosnian war. Bosnian Serbs have repeatedly rejected the Contact Group's peace plan, which calls on them to give up part of the territory they hold now.
