1 Japan's personal computer market surged 34.7 percent last year, topping 3 million units for the first time, a private research company said Monday.
2 Shipment of new personal computers in Japan totaled 3.32 million units in 1994, up from 2.46 million in 1993, Dataquest Japan said.
3 Dataquest attributed the sharp growth to lower prices of high-performance PCs and efforts by many large corporations to boost computer literacy among employees.
4 Because of the sluggish economy, shipments of personal computers in japan had risen just 10 percent between 1990 and 1993.
5 NEC Corp., the Japanese market leader, shipped 1.56 million units last year, up 19.8 percent from the previous year. But NEC's market share slipped from 53.4 percent in 1993 to 47.0 percent as competitors helped expand the overall market.
6 Apple, which shipped 342,800 PCs to Japan in 1993, increased its share from 13.9 percent to 15.5 percent by selling a total of 513,500 units in 1994.
7 IBM Japan Ltd. grabbed 10.0 percent of the market, with 331,900 units, pushing Fujitsu Ltd. out of third place. Fujitsu shipped 307,000 PCs to capture a 9.3 percent market share.
