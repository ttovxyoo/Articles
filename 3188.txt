1 A court ruled Tuesday that a Palestinian woman cannot be turned over to Germany to face accessory to murder charges in the 1977 hijacking of a Lufthansa airliner.
2 The Oslo preliminary court blocked extradition because Norway's 15-year statute of limitations had run out on accessory to murder or attempted murder charges, said court secretary Ketil Bjornbach.
3 A higher court, the Oslo superior court, is now expected to rule on the same issue: whether 41-year-old Suhaila Al Sayeh can be extradited to Germany.
4 Al Sayeh, known as Souhaila Andrawes in Norway, was the only one of four hijackers to survive the 1977 hijacking.
5 She was severely wounded when German anti-terror police stormed the plane in Mogadishu, Somalia. The hijackers had shot and killed the airliner's pilot and threatened passengers.
6 The woman was arrested on Oct. 13 in Oslo after 17 years on the run. She had served a brief prison term in Somalia and then disappeared. Al Sayeh had lived in Oslo for three years with her husband and young daughter.
7 Tuesday's finding was one in a series of rulings and reversals as Germany's request for her extradition on hijacking and other charges moved through Norway's court system.
8 The prelimary court previously blocked extradition on hijacking charges, but was reversed in December by the country's highest court, the superior court, which ruled in favor of extradition.
9 Last month, the supreme court blocked extradition and sent the case back to the lower courts because they failed to consider murder-related charges, which it said was the only obstacle to extradition.
10 The defense and prosecution have three days in which to file appeals. The case could reach the supreme court again before the Norwegian government makes the final decision on extradition.
