1 Sweden completed its remarkable comeback Sunday, winning both reverse singles to beat Denmark 3-2 -- only the fourth time in World Group Davis Cup history a country has won after losing both opening singles.
2 Stefan Edberg defeated Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) in the opening match Sunday to even the best-of-5 tie at 2-2 and then Jonas Bjorkman completed the victory with a 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-4 victory over Frederik Fetterlein.
3 'If I had lost both my games against the Danes, I just wouldn't have survived,' Edberg said jokingly.
4 It was the third time Sweden has rallied from two matches down in World Group play. It beat Canada in 1992 in the first round and overcame the United States in last year's semifinals.
5 Mexico was the other country to win after losing the opening two matches in 1988.
6 Carlsen and Fetterlein won their opening singles to put the defending champion against the wall and put Denmark in position for one of the biggest upsets in Davis Cup history.
7 But Jan Apell and Bjorkman, who was substituting for an ill Magnus Larsson, combined to beat Carlsen and Morten Christensen 6-7 (6-8), 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 in doubles to keep Sweden alive.
8 Sunday's decisive moment became a nerve-breaking fight between Fetterlein and Bjorkman. After splitting the first two sets, Bjorkman had a 4-0 lead in the fifth, but Fetterlein fought back to 4-5 before the Swede prevailed.
9 'I was very close to making it in the final set, but he (Bjorkman) was the best,' said Fetterlein.
