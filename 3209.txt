1 Nearly 200 women marched through the city of Dhaka on Wednesday to demand that their university drop rules they regard as sexist, including one that forbids them to leave their dormitories after sunset.
2 'Down with male chauvinism!' yelled the protesters, who also want Dhaka University to scrap rules that discourage male students from talking to women on campus, and force female students to receive permission from their parents to stay out overnight.
3 Although many women students ignore the 40-year-old rules at the nation's largest college, the university can fine or expel females caught violating the regulations.
4 'The country's constitution does not discriminate between males and females, so why should the university authorities?' asked Rokayya Khatoon, a senior arts student. 'These restrictions are insult to the womanhood,' she said in an interview.
5 Placards carried by the demonstrators read: 'Character can't be built by restrictions!' and 'We want our freedom!'
6 Women make up one-third of Dhaka University's 28,000 students in Dhaka, the capital of Islamic and male-dominated Bangladesh.
7 Many of the students read feminist author Taslima Nasrin, who left Bangladesh for Europe after Muslim fundamentalists offered rewards for her assassination and she was charged with blasphemy for allegedly urging changes in the Koran, the Muslim holy book.
8 Emajuddin Ahmed, vice chancellor of Dhaka University, met with a delegation of the protesters, and he reportedly told them their parents must ask the school to change the rules.
