1 Third-seeded Magdalena Maleeva took advantage of 14 double faults to beat second-seeded Gabriela Sabatini 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 on Saturday and advance to the finals of the Ameritech Cup tennis tournament.
2 Maleeva will meet the winner of Saturday night's evening match between the seventh seed, Zina Garrison-Jackson, and Lisa Raymond in the title match on Sunday.
3 The 11th-ranked Maleeva utilized a vicious two-handed backhand to capture the first set, breaking Sabatini in the second game.
4 Sabatini broke Maleeva in the ninth game of the set with a great scoop passing shot to trail 5-4, only to give away the set with a double fault on set point in the 10th game.
5 In the second set, Sabatini took a 5-4 lead when Maleeva hit a return out of bounds and then won it with a 98 mph service winner on set point.
6 The match turned in the sixth game of the third set, when Sabatini double-faulted twice in losing her serve to fall behind 4-2.
7 The match ended when Sabatini netted a return.
8 The fact that the crowd in the UIC Pavilion was solidly behind Sabatini didn't bother Maleeva.
9 'In Bulgaria, they do not cheer for me either,' she said. 'If I'm in Germany, they cheer for the Germans, and it is no different in the States. Gabby is a crowd-pleaser.'
10 Not having played Sabatini before on the WTA tour 'did not bother me,' Maleeva said. 'I did have to hit balls deeper to keep her away from the net.'
11 Maleeva, 19, has no fear following her sisters, Manuela and Katerina, into pro tennis. 'I will be better than my sisters; I've been told that by mother and others.'
12 Sabatini called the youngest Maleeva 'a very good player, but I was very tired. She served very well, especially at the end. Today I didn't serve very well. I didn't feel very comfortable. But in tennis today, you have to be prepared to play a very tough first round. You can never take it easy.'
