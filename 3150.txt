1 A huge wave, reportedly 50 feet (15 meters) high, hit the coast of this picturesque tourist town Sunday, sweeping a woman out to sea and breaking the leg of her male companion who was thrown on the rocks.
2 The injured man was pulled from the rocks by someone who dashed out of a nearby restaurant, but the woman could not be seen.
3 No search boats could be launched in the high seas, so rescuers pinned their hopes on a search helicopter which scanned the waves with a powerful searchlight late Sunday.
4 The man was taken to Victoria General Hospital in nearby Halifax, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northeast. Neither he nor the missing woman were identified by authorities.
5 Waves were reported about 15 meters (50 feet) high at the time of the accident.
6 The couple 'were in what would normally be a fairly safe spot,' said Judy Dauphinee, who works at the Sou-wester restaurant overlooking the scenic rocks and lighthouse. But she added that the waves were higher than she had ever seen.
7 The waves were generated by a tremendous windstorm that hit Saturday night.
