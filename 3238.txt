1 Edward Leary limped into court Wednesday to plead innocent to more charges stemming from a homemade bomb that sent a fireball whooshing through a subway car, injuring him and 47 others.
2 The crude bomb went off Dec. 21 while the subway train was parked in a station. Leary is charged with attempted murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and attempted grand larceny.
3 Leary, of Scotch Plains, New Jersey, was arraigned on a superseding indictment that added 35 counts from the Dec. 21 blast, along with charges stemming from another subway firebombing six days earlier.
4 Leary, 49, is being held in the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital. He pleaded innocent at a bedside arraignment on the original indictment Jan. 10.
5 Authorities say Leary's alleged firebombings were part of a subterranean reign of terror aimed at extorting cash from the city's transit agency. Authorities allege that the bomb was in his lap and went off accidentally.
6 Defense lawyer Stephen Murphy claims his client was simply another victim of the firebomb, and that notes police found in Leary's home were outlines for unpublished science fiction novels.
7 Murphy agreed Wednesday to provide samples of Leary's handwriting Wednesday.
8 The first firebombing cited in the new charges occurred Dec. 15 on a subway car in Harlem. Three teen-agers were injured.
