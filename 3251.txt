1 A district court on Thursday sentenced a woman to six years in prison on charges of involvement in an Islamic separatist movement in Indonesia's northernmost province of Aceh.
2 Nurhayati Hasan, 47, was the fifth and last defendant sentenced in a series of subversion cases since Dec. 5 in the North Aceh capital of Lhokseumawe, 1,660 kilometers (1,037 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
3 The first four were all men, including Mrs. Hasan's husband, Muhammad Amin Panga. They were sentenced to terms ranging from nine to 20 years.
4 Judge Abubakar Ib found Nurhayati Hasan guilty of supporting the Free Aceh Movement, which wants to set up an Islamic state in the province.
5 Abubakar described her activities as undermining the Indonesian government and constitution as well as the state ideology.
6 Since 1991, nearly 60 alleged members or supporters of the movement have been sentenced to prison in the predominantly Muslim province.
7 The insurgency has led to the deaths of about 2,000 civilians, including children and the elderly, since 1989.
