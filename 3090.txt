1 Expanding NATO into eastern Europe would give Russia more security, not less as Moscow fears, the alliance's secretary-general said Friday.
2 'We are willing to cooperate with Russia,' Willy Claes said. 'We are not trying to isolate Russia. I will sing this every day, if necessary, in order to convince Moscow that we have good intentions.'
3 Claes was in Bonn before a Saturday meeting in Munich of Western defense leaders and military chiefs.
4 NATO is studying how former Soviet allies might join the alliance. It has named no candidates, set no entry dates. But Russia is upset and has put off a broad program of military and political cooperation with NATO.
5 Moscow is worried of being isolated if NATO takes in Poland, Hungary and others as members. Its bloody intervention in Chechnya has made east European countries especially eager to join because they could then gain the alliance's protection from Russia.
6 Claes found conciliatory words for Russia even though Western nations have voiced concern about its use of force in Chechnya.
7 NATO's enlargement would not mean isolation but 'bringing more security to Russia,' he said, because NATO is ready for broad military cooperation and an 'enhanced dialogue' on nuclear arms and security issues.
