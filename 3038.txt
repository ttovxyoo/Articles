1 An animal rights protester was killed Wednesday when she slipped and fell under a truck as she tried to stop it during a demonstration against the export of live calves.
2 Police said Jill Phipps, 31, was crushed by the slow-moving truck as it delivered 100 calves to the airport at Coventry 80 miles (125 km) northwest of London for export to the Netherlands.
3 About 100 police guarded the entrance to the airport. But eyewitnesses said that Ms. Phipps, who had a nine-year-old boy, and about 40 other demonstrators evaded them and ran to the truck.
4 She and three other people tried to climb onto the cab of the truck but she slipped.
5 Agriculture Minister William Waldegrave said he in a statement that he 'deeply regretted this tragic incident.' The calves were eventually loaded onto a plane and flown to the Netherlands.
6 Animal rights activists say thousands of British calves exported to continental Europe end up confined in tiny crates, unable to move for several months while they are fattened for slaughter. Lack of movement preserves the delicacy of the meat.
7 The crates are banned in Britain on grounds of cruelty. But attempts by Britain to persuade its partners in the European Union to impose a similar ban have so far failed and the campaign by protesters against the export of live British calves plus live sheep has escalated in recent months.
8 Activists claimed a victory last month when shipments of live animals by sea from the southern English port of Shoreham-on-Sea to continental Europe were banned following weeks of costly and disruptive protests against the trade.
