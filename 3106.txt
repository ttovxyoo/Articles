1 Authorities hope to open Indonesia's first nuclear power plant by 2004, it was reported Saturday.
2 'The development of the plant would begin in 2000 and the first unit is expected to go into operation four years later,' energy official Djali Ahimsyah was quoted by the daily Bisnis Indonesia as saying.
3 Ahimsyah told a parliamentary hearing Friday that a feasibility study by Japanese consultants recommended two 1,500-megawatt nuclear plants be built in Java.
4 The study was submitted to President Suharto on Dec. 31 last year.
5 President Suharto has reiterated the necessity of nuclear plant, saying future generations would need the benefits of nuclear energy.
6 However, state minister for research and technology, B.J. Habibie, has recently said that nuclear power still has a low priority in Indonesia's energy program.
7 Indonesian environmental groups have criticized the government for not allowing public debate on the issue of nuclear development.
