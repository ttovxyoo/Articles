1 Security men blocked journalists of Serbia's sole independent daily from entering their offices Saturday in the authorities' latest move to muzzle the media.
2 Two women journalists were slightly injured in a spontaneous protest outside the building in central Belgrade. They were bruised when the 50 journalists, who blocked traffic, were forced aside by three cars bearing stickers of a Serbian paramilitary leader.
3 'Throwing out the journalists is a brutal and uncivilized act,' said Radivoj Cvjeticanin, deputy chief editor of the daily Nasa Borba (Our Struggle).
4 Cvjeticanin said the reporters would continue producing the daily from the premises of the Independent Unions Association.
5 Late last year, the government of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic used a legal loophole to deny the daily Borba approval for its 1991 transformation to a shareholding company. It formed a state-controlled enterprise under the same name.
6 Only a few of Borba's almost 200 workers went over to the government daily. The government and independent dailies appeared side by side for weeks under the same name.
7 But the independents lost a court battle over the paper's name and assets. In January, they then registered a new daily, Nasa Borba.
8 The independent crew remained in its old premises, where security men barred their entry Saturday. No uniformed police were at the scene.
