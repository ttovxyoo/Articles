1 Concerned about increases in consumer prices, the Polish government Friday announced measures intended to prevent food prices from rising further.
2 The measures include selling food such as cereals, butter, and sugar from state reserves at below-market prices and guaranteeing duty-free imports of 1.5 million metric tons of grain, Deputy Finance Minister Ryszard Pazura said.
3 The Treasury will try to curb monopoly practices and prevent retailers from setting retail margins too high, he said.
4 The government will also look carefully at special duties imposed on imported agricultural products to protect Polish farmers and will consider reducing the duties.
5 Economists suggest this is one of the reasons of the prices are growing so rapidly in Poland.
6 Poland's government has set an ambitious plan to cut inflation to 17 percent in 1995, and capping rising food prices is necessary to meet that goal. Prices were up 29.5 percent in December last year over December 1993.
7 The Finance Ministry reported recently that prices increased 3.2 percent in January over December instead of the projected 2.6 percent.
