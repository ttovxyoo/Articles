1 One person was killed and four wounded when a grenade exploded on a city bus Wednesday. It wasn't immediately known if the blast was linked to a general strike.
2 The explosion occurred in Burundi's capital Bujumbura. Lt. Col. Nicodemus Nduhirubusa said it was unclear whether the grenade was thrown into the bus or exploded by a passenger.
3 The strike was called Wednesday by the predominantly Tutsi opposition to press for the resignation of Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko, said Nduhirubusa, the official's military and security adviser.
4 Large numbers of people did stay away from work Wednesday, but the general strike failed to shut down commerce or paralyze the city.
5 The opposition has demanded Kanyenkiko's resignation, claiming he supported Jean Minani, a former speaker of the National Assembly who allegedly incited Hutus to kill Tutsis in 1993. Minani, who denied the charged, resigned his post last month.
6 Continuing violence between majority Hutu and minority Tutsi ethnic groups has prompted fears of an ethnic bloodbath in Burundi similar to last year's in Rwanda.
7 On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali warned that 'everyone looking to destabilize the situation in Burundi . must understand that the international community will not sit with its arms crossed.'
8 Tutsi leaders said the strike was called after President Silvester Ntibantunganya fired two prominent opposition figures for failing to attend a Cabinet meeting.
9 Opposition legislators threatened to quit Ntibantunganya's coalition government and boycotted duties for nearly a week until Minani resigned.
10 The opposition alleges Minani urged Hutus to kill Tutsi after the slaying of President Melchior Ndadaye, the country's first Hutu leader, by elements of the Tutsi dominated military in an October 1993 abortive coup.
11 An estimated 100,000 people were slain in the bloodbath that followed Ndadaye's slaying.
