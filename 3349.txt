1 Cuban dissident Rodolfo Gonzalez arrived here Monday as a political refugee after spending 28 months in prison in Cuba on charges of spreading false information about the Caribbean nation.
2 Gonzalez, a member of the Committee for Human Rights, was released from prison Sunday and put on a plane early Monday morning in Havana, according to Alberto Junco, European representative for the Cuban Democratic Platform.
3 A foreign ministry spokesman said Spain, which worked towards Gonzalez's release, had granted him political asylum.
4 The Committee for Human Rights is headed by Miami-based Ricardo Bofill.
5 The ministry spokesman also said 34 Cuban refugees were scheduled to arrive later Monday from a U.S. detention camp in Panama, the second group which Spain has agreed to take in. All the refugees have family ties with people already in Spain.
6 He said another four Cubans were scheduled to arrive Friday from Panama.
7 Spain was the first country to grant residence to any of the thousands of Cubans who left the island for the United States last year in makeshift boats and rafts. They were picked up by U.S. vessels and interned in U.S. bases after Washington refused to allow them to enter the United States.
8 The first group of 72 Cubans arrived in Spain last December.
